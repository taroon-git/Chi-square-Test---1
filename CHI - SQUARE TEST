#Q:- How many number of hours student study in a weekly basis daily ?

#Q: In 2010 Census of the city, The weight(kg) of the individuals in a small city were found to be the following.

  | <50  | 50-70 | >75 |
  | 20 % | 30%   | 50% |
 
#In 2020, ages of n = 500 individuals were sampled. Below are the results.

 | <50  | 50-70 | >75 |
 | 140  | 160   | 200 |
#Using significance value = 0.05 , would you conclude the population difference of weight changed in the last 10 years?

# Q:- 
Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were surveyed and ,
#each person was asked to report the highest education level they obtained.
#The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the following table:

         # HighSchool	    Bachelors	  Masters	   Ph.d.     Total
 # Female       60	        54	       46       41	         201
 # Male	        40	        44	       53	    57	         194
 # Total	    100	        98	       99	    98	         395

# Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In other words, given the data collected 
# above, is there a relationship between the gender of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?
